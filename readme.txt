How to run the live server:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

2. Open a terminal, make sure you are root directory of the project and write: "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies.

3. Once the dependencies are installed, write "npm run dev" to run the dev script, and the live server should be running. The host is shown in the terminal.
